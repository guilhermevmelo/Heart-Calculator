Heart-Calculator
================

This is a project developed over the Summer of 2014 at Swansea University under 
supervision of Dr. Xianghua Xie, as part of the Brazilian Science Without Borders Programme.

The aim is to rebuild the tool "Heart Forecast" using platform independent technologies, as 
HTML5 with CSS3 and JavaScript, optimized for mobile phones.
